# Image Super-Resolution: SRResNet vs ESRGAN-Lite

A comparative study on objective accuracy vs perceptual quality in deep learning-based image super-resolution using SRResNet and a lightweight ESRGAN-Lite architecture.

📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation, training pipeline, evaluation, and deployment of two deep learning models for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) with a 4× upscaling factor:

SRResNet – PSNR/MAE-oriented baseline model

ESRGAN-Lite – Lightweight perceptual model optimized for visual realism

The study quantifies the trade-off between objective reconstruction accuracy and perceptual fidelity, using the DIV2K dataset.
